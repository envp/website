Hi! I'm Vaibhav. I'm someone who loves to lose myself in the details of whatever
I engage in to a failure. I'm curious how things are made, and how I can better them.

I made this website to record interesting fact<sup>[oid]</sup>s as I find them.
Typically these'll be short exploratory articles about programming, languages,
science and pretty much anything else that can hold my rather short attention
span. :^)

The source code for this page lives [here][1], the theme is called [`hugo-xmin`][hugo-xmin].

If you wish to do so, the best way to provide feedback is to create an issue on
the repo where this code lives. I cannot promise a fast response, but I certainly
appreciate constructive feedback, as I'm here to learn. [Here's a quick link][2].
I generally do not respond to emails, especially marketing and similar spam.

And last, but not least:
