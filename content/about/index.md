I'm Vaibhav Yenamandra and this is my (revived) blog.

I work for Bloomberg L.P. as a software engineer on the Static Analysis and Automated Refactoring Team.


I'd add a reassuring picture to convince you I am not an AI, but I don't have one right now, so you'll have to take my word for it.

There's a lot I need to learn, and this page might help me speed up the process.
How? Through essays on technical and life challenges I face so I can refer to them later.
Sometimes these will be articles about tech, sometimes about dealing with life, or just rants.
