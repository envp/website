I&amp;rsquo;m someone who loves to lose myself in the details of whatever I engage in to a failure. I&amp;rsquo;m curious how things are made, and how I can better them.
I made this website to record interesting fact[oid]s as I find them. Typically these&amp;rsquo;ll be short exploratory articles about programming, languages, science and pretty much anything else that can hold my rather short attention span. :^)
The source code for this page lives here, the theme is called hugo-xmin.</description></item></channel></rss>
